Encapsulation
	public		- accessible by anyone
	private		- accessible by this class only
	protected	- accessible by this and derived classes only

Inheritance
	You can create a subclass from a base class.
	You can extend behavior by adding new members.
	You can specialize behavior by redefining members.
		Use virtual functions in the base class if they will be redefined in derived class
		Use pure virtual functions to make an abstract base class that can have no instances.
		Always make destructors virtual (due to polymorphism)

	Base constructed first.
	Base destructed last.

Polymorphism
	You can use a base pointer to access any variable of a derived class
