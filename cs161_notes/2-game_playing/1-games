GAMES

We now discuss competitive environments, where the goals of different agents are in conflict, leading to adversarial search, or games.
The most common games are deterministic, fully observable, turn-taking, two-player, "zero-sum games of perfect information". This means at the end of each turn the utility values are always equal opposite, ie if one player wins then the other loses.
Games have much greater branching factors than previous problems we dealt with.
Pruning allows us to narrow down our choices.
Heuristics allow us to evaluate the utility of a state without doing a complete search.
Sometimes games have elements of chance, and of incomplete information.

A game is a search with the following properties:
	S0 - the initial state
	Player - whose turn is it?
	Actions - legal moves available?
	Results - A transition model that defines the result of each move
	Terminal-Test - Has the game reached a terminal state, meaning is it over?
	Utility - A utility function (objective function) defines the numeric values at each terminal state (e.g. 1-win, 0-loss, 1/2-draw). Zero-sum means the sum of both sides is always this same (1 in the example).

We now have our GAME tree.
