STOCHASTIC GAMES

Stochastic games involve a random event like throwing dice.
We must then include chance nodes in addition to min and max.
Instead of a fixed minimax we have an expected value: the average of the possible values.

We go from max to chance to min to chance...

expectiminimax(state)
	utility(state)													if terminal_test(state)
	max of all expectiminimax(result(state,action))					if player is max
	min of all expectiminimax(result(state,action))					if player is min
	sum of probability(roll) * expectiminimax(result(state,roll))	if player is chance

O(b^m n^m) where n is the number of distinct rolls

It is possible to alpha beta prune chance rolls, even if chance is supposed to find an average of rolls.
Place an extreme bound, and use the extreme bound instead of having to calculate a value.
