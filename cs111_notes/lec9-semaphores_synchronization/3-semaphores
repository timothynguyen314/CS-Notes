Semaphores
	Invented by Edsger Dijkstra
	An integer value we can manipulate w two operations: sem_wait() and sem_post()
	A negative semaphore is equal to the number of waiting threads

	#include<semaphore.h>
	sem_t s;
	sem_init(&s, 0, 1); //initialized to 1, the 0 indicates that the semaphore is shared by all threads in the same process

	sem_wait() returns right away if the semaphore is 1 or higher
	or it suspends execution until sem_post() is called

	sem_post() increments a semaphore and, if a thread is waiting to be woken up, does so
