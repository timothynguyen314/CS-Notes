DEADLOCKS

Deadlock Conditions
	Mutual Exclusion
		There exists critical sections that require locks.
		Can be fixed by making the critical section atomic, performed a single operation, so that no lock is necessary.
	Incremental Allocation (Hold-And-Wait)
		A thread/process holds resources from one critical section while waiting for another critical section.
		Can be fixed by making acquiring resources all-or-none.
	No Preemption
		We are unable to preempt threads/processes with locks.
	Circular Waiting
		There is a cycle in the dependency graph of resource requests.
		Can be fixed by having a "total ordering" for all resources.
