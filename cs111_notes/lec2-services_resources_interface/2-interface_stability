INTERFACE STABILITY

When you use "open", there are a hundred different implementations for open, but they all have the same interface.

The interface is a contract. It promises the functionality of the implementaiton--it will accomplish at least that.
If something works with the interface, if you understand the interface, you're fine.
So always trust the interface will work, such as on a platform you have no control over.

We want as many implementations as possible to work with the interface, and other interfaces must work with our interface.
We work w/ the interface, never the implementation b/c the implementation can switch out.

Backwards compatability - support older program. Methods:
	interface polymorphism - polymorphism is using the same name, but we can change the parameters and methods in our new version.
	versioned interface - apps support after a certain version.

	Make clear how long you expect to support an interface before dropping it.

Tips for interface stability:
	Include features in your interface you might not implement now, but in the future.
	High abstraction means more flexibility for future changes.
	Less functionality between components makes changing easier.
