INTRO TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

What does the OS do?
	The OS abstracts the hardware.
		Memory Management
		Scheduling of Processes
		File Systems
		Security of Resources
		Network Protocol

	Applications -> Libraries -> OS -> Hardware
	
	Applications interact with Libraries through the Application Binary Interface.
	Libraries interact with the OS through the System Call Interface.

	Applications and Libraries possess a standard instruction set.
	The OS possesses a priveleged instruction set.

	ISA
		The Instruction Set Architecture determines what bit patterns correspond to what operations.
		An OS wants to run on as many ISAs as possible, on as many different machines.
	API/ABI
		Application Programming Interfaces (API) are used by programmers. It describes routines, parameters, options, errors, return values, etc.
		Application Binary Interfaces (ABI) are machine language instructions. It is the binding of an API to an ISA.
		APIs/ABIs are OS specific, while an ISA is hardware specific.
