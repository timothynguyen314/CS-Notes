THREADS

What is a thread?
	Threads run within the same process.
	Threads have their own stack, PC, and registers.
	Threads share the same address space/page table, unlike processes.

	You never know what thread is currently running.
	You can call join() to wait for all children to finish before resuming.

	Parallelism improves throughput, modularity (breaking up a task into pieces), and robustness (a failure of one task does not affect others).
