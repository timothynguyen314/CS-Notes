THE PROCESS

What is the process?
	A process is an object with state/operations.
	It is an executing instance of a program.
	Memory Layout
		Code
			Statically sized.
			Read in from the load module.
			Read/execute only.
			Shareable with other processes.
		Data
			Grows up from beginning.
			Dynamically allocated by user.
			Read/write only.
			Private to each process.
		Stack
			Grows down from end.
			Grows with function calls.
			Read/write only.
			Private to each process.
	Processes are run on the CPU with limited direct execution:
		They are run directly on the CPU for efficiency
		They are given limited access (CPU has user and kernel mode)
How is a process made?
	fork()
		Windows will create processes from scratch.
		Linux/Unix will create processes by copying from the current process.

		Each process shares code, but get their own data and stack.
		Each process has its own virtual address space.
	executable
		Source modules are compiled into object modules.
		Object modules are linked into load modules.
		Load modules are loaded into memory to be executed.
