MEMORY

Virtual Address Space
	Virtual Address Spaces only contain the memory of processes, and does not contain the OS.
	The total memory of all processes exceeds the capacity of the physical address space.
	The physical address space is also hard to understand, so we must virtualize it.
Heap
	The heap is represented as a "free list".
	Problems
		External Fragmentation
			Having no room for a unit, but the combination of total free space exceeds the size of the unit
		Internal Fragmentation
			Allocating too much space for a unit
	Strategies
		Best Fit
			Find all sizes that fit, choose the smallest one.
			Leads to external fragmentation.
		Worst Fit
			Find all sizes that fit, choose the biggest one.
			Takes too much time to find all sizes that fit.
		First Fit
			Find the first size that fits.
			Pollutes the beginning of the list.
		Next Fit
			Find the next fit after the first search.

		Segregated Lists/Buffer Pools
			If a certain size is repeatedly request, make a list just for it.
			This reduces fragmentation.
		Buddy Allocation
			Continually "split" list in half until you find a size that fits.
			Continually "coalesce" halves when you free space.
	Garbage Collection
		Sometimes programming languages use a garbage collector instead of freeing dynamically allocated data manually.
		It keeps track of all references to every object.
		When the number of references reaches zero, it frees the object.
