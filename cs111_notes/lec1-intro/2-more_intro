MORE INTRO TO OS

Von Neumann model - A processor fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, then executes it.

The Operating System (OS) controls everything. Three big topics:
	Virtualization - makes the physical computer easy to understand.
		Making a single processor seem like many is a virtualization.
		The virtual address space, physical memory with its reads and writes, is a virtualization.
	Concurrency is second topic.
	Persistence is third topic.
		Storing data persistently via file system by using system calls provided by standard library.

Design Goals:
	Abstraction - easy to understand
	Performance - minimize overhead
	Protection - isolation of applications
	Energy Efficiency, Mobility, etc.

History:
	batch processing - OS was libraries. A human would manage everything, act as the modern OS.

	Soon system calls were developed, separating user and kernel modes. Traps would initiate system calls.
	With minicomputers, more people started getting computers.
	Multiprogramming eventually came about.
	With personal computers, everybody had a computer.

Unix
	A shell is where you type commands.
	It provided a compiler for the C language.
	It combined small programs.
	
	Linux, derived from Unix, is widely used today.
