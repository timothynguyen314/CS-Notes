MEMORY API

Stack memory is managed by the compiler, and is sometimes called automatic memory.
Heap memory is handled by the user. It's more useful, but more prone to bugs.

void* malloc(size_t size);
	Allocate space on the heap!
	Ex: malloc(sizeof(int));
	Aside: sizeof() is an operator, not a function call, since the size is already known, while function calls take place at runtime.
	Remember to free() when you're done.

Errors:
	-Forgetting to allocate memory
	-Not allocating enough memory - buffer overflow
	-Forgetting to initialize allocated memory
	-Forgetting to free memory - memory leak
	-Freeing memory before you're done with it - dangling pointer
	-Freeing repeatedly - double-free
	-Freeing non-pointers
