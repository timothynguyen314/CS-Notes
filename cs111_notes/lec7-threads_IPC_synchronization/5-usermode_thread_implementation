USER MODE THREAD IMPLEMENTATION

Processes are expensive. And they can't share in-memory resources w each other.
When threads were first introduced in Linux, they were entirely implemented in the user mode library w no OS involvement.

However, because there is no OS involvement, if a thread blocks, the entire process is blocked.
And the OS cannot know to run threads on multiple processors.
And thus threads should be implemented in the OS.
