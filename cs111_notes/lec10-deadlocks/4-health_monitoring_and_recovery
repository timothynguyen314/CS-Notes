HEALTH MONITORING AND RECOVERY

How to tell a system went into deadlock?
	Make a dependency graph where you identify all blocked processes and the resources they own/are waiting on.
	See if there's a loop.
	But maybe all that information isn't present to us.

Health Monitoring
	We should have an internal monitoring agent regularly check for failures, or make periodic reports to a central monitoring agent.
	The software should be designed so that any process can be killed or restarted at anytime.
	"mark out thresholds" is a tradeoff between waiting too long to detect errors or making false reports.
