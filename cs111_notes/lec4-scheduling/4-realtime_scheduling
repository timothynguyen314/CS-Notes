REAL-TIME SCHEDULING

A real-time system is one whose correctness depends on functionality and timing.

static scheduling - define a schedule at build time when given a list of all tasks
dynamic scheduling - in the moment

Preemption is not favorable in real-time systems.
It causes tasks to miss deadlines.
Also such systems usually run fewer and simpler tasks, so infinite loops are rare.
