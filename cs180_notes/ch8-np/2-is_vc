INDEPENDENT SET/VERTEX COVER

PROBLEM:
	We have a graph with n nodes and m edges.

GOAL:
	Largest independent set S is a set of nodes such that no nodes share ane edge with each other.
	Smallest vertex cover S is a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one edge covered by S..

	We will show that they are polynomial time reducible to each other, and thus show that they are equivalently hard.

PROOF:
	If V is the set of nodes.
	S is an independent set if and only if V-S is a vertex cover.

	For every edge (u,v), u and v can't both be in S. And so every edge is covered by S and V-S.

	Thus if we can solve one to be of size k, we can get the other by n-k.

2nd GOAL:
	A set cover S is a set of subsets. We want the minimum number of subsets of edges whose union equals all edges.
	Prove a vertex cover is polynomial time reducible to a set cover.

PROOF:
	If we have a set cover for edges, each vertex in the subset makes a vertex cover.
