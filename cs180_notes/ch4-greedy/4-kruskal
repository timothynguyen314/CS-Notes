PROBLEM:
	We have a graph with n vertices and m weighted edges.

GOAL:
	We want to find a minimum spanning tree (MST): a tree containing all vertices such that the sum of the edge weights is minimized.

ALGORITHM:
	-Start with an empty tree T
	-Add the two vertices with the minimum edge.

	-Successively add the next lowest edge as long as it doesn't create a cycle.

COMPLEXITY:
	-We first sort m edges by cost, O(mlogm). This is also O(mlogn)
	-For each edge (v,w) we do Find(v) and Find(w), O(2mlogn) = O(mlogn)
	-We do O(n-1)=O(n) Unions

	-O(mlogn)
