PRIM

PROBLEM:
	We have a graph with n vertices and m weighted edges.

GOAL:
	We want to find a minimum spanning tree (MST): a tree containing all vertices such that the sum of the edge weights is minimized.

ALGORITHM:
	-Divide the graph into two partitions S and T, where T initially has all the vertices.
	-Add a random vertex from T to S.

	-Successively add the vertex from T to S with the minimum edge between S and T

COMPLEXITY:
	O(mlogn) due to similar implementation as Dijkstra's algorithm. We have to use and update a heap to search for the minimum edges connected to T.
