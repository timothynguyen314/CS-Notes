PROBLEM:
	We have a graph with n vertices and m edges.

GOAL:
	We want to determine a connected component of the graph.

ALGORITHM:
	-Pick a vertex v.

	-Mark all unvisited neighbors of this vertex as visited by looking at each edge.
	-Repeat for each neighbor

COMPLEXITY:
	O(m+n) because we look at n vertices and m edges.

PROPERTIES:
	Each Level Ln below the vertex v represents the shortest distance of n from v to the vertices in Ln.
	The BFS tree represents a connected component.
	Implemented with a queue.
