GRAPHS

A graph consists of vertices and edges.

A graph can have directed or undirected edges.
A graph can have weighted or unweighted edges.

A graph can be connected or unconnected.
A directed graph can be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from others.

A tree is a connected, acyclic graph. If it has n vertices, it has n-1 edges.

A graph can be bipartite, meaning it has no odd cycles, and there are two groups of vertices that are only connected to each other and not within each other.
