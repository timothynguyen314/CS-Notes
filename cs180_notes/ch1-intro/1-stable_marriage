STABLE MARRIAGE

PROBLEM:
	There are n men and women. Each man has a preference list containing all the n other women. Each woman has a preference list containing all the n other men.

GOAL:
	Match every man with a woman, and vice versa, such that there is no instability. An instability is defined as:

		Man u prefers Woman v over Woman v'.
		Woman v prefers Man u over Man u'.

		Man u is matched with Woman v'.
		Man u' is matched with Woman v.

ALGORITHM:
	-Find an available man
	-Look at the woman highest on his priority list that he hasn't asked yet, and ask her
		-if woman is available, match them
		-if woman is taken, compare the man asking with the man she is currently with on her priority list, and take the one higher
	-Repeat above steps until all men are unavailable

PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
	-Suppose an instability exists
		-u would have asked v before v'
			-if u asked before u'
				-if u was rejected, u' would have been rejected too
				-if u was not rejected, u' could not have replaced him
			-if u asked after u'
				-impossible since it should have replaced u'
		-thus it is impossible for an instability to exist

	-Suppose a man and woman are unmatched
		-the man must have asked the woman at some point since he must go through his entire list
		-the woman can only reject the man if she is already taken, but we're saying she's free, meaning nobody else has asked her
		-thus it is impossible for there to be an unmatched pair

COMPLEXITY:
	O(n^2) because n men can potentially ask n women
