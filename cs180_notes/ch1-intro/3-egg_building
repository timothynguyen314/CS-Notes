PROBLEM:
	We have two eggs. We have a 100-story building.

GOAL:
	We want to find the highest floor we can drop the egg from without breaking.
	We also want to minimize the number of drops needed.

SOLUTION:
	-Let's say it will take n drops.

	-We drop the first egg at the n floor.
	-If it breaks, we try from 1 to n-1 with the second egg.
	
	-If it doesn't break, because we have n-1 drops left, we drop the first egg from the n+(n-1) floor.
	-If it breaks, we try from n+1 to n+(n-2) with the second egg

	-If it doesn't break, because we have n-2 drops left, we drop the first egg from the n+(n-1)+(n-2) floor.

	n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = 100
	(n)(n+1)/2 = 100
	n = 14

	It will take a minimum of 14 drops to find the highest floor we can drop the egg from.
