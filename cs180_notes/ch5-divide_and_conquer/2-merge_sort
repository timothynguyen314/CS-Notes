MERGE SORT

PROBLEM:
	We have a set of n numbers.

GOAL:
	We want to sort them in increasing order.

ALGORITHM:
	-Split the set into two.
	-Split the subsets into two.

	-Continue until subsets consist of two numbers.
	-Sort two numbers by simple comparison.

	-Merge subsets together, by only looking at heads of subsets and adding the smaller until both subsets are empty.

COMPLEXITY:
	-Dividing n numbers into two groups takes O(n) time since we must determine a subset for each of the n numbers. Combining them takes O(n) time since we make n comparisons at each level.
	-We divide and combine log2n times.
	O(nlogn)
