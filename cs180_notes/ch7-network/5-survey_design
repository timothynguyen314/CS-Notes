SURVEY DESIGN

PROBLEM:
	There are n customers and m products.

GOAL:
	We want to ask a customer i about a subset of the products they bought, between size ci and ci'.
	Each product j must have between pj and pj' customers asked about it.

ALGORITHM:
	A source s goes to each customer, with capacity ci', and lower bound ci.
	An edge exists from a customer to a product if they bought the product, of capacity 1.
	A sink t goes from each product, with capacity pj', and lower bound pj.

	Apply Ford-Fulkerson.
	If a flow exists that fulfills all the lower bounds, then we have our survey design.
