MAXIMUM FLOW (aka FORD-FULKERSON)

PROBLEM:
	We have a flow network, with source s and sink t.

GOAL:
	We want to calculate the maximum flow from s to t.

ALGORITHM:
	The maximum flow is the minimum cut.

	While there is still a path from s to t (capacities aren't 0)
		-Run a flow along the path, augmenting it to maximize flow.
		-Update graph.

COMPLEXITY:
	If C is the maximum flow out of s, because the FF algorithm can increase a minimum of 1 each turn, it can iterate at most C times.
	And each turn of the FF algorithm visits at most 2m edges in the residual graph.
