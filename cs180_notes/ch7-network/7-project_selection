PROJECT SELECTION

PROBLEM:
	We have n projects.
	Each project has a revenue, positive or negative.
	Some projects are prerequisities for other projects.
	A project be a prerequisite for many others.
	A project can have many prerequisities.

GOAL:
	We want to maximize profit.

ALGORITHM:
	We want to construct a graph such that the minimum cut shows which projects should be included to maximize profit.

	We add a source s that goes to all the projects with positive revenue, with capacity=revenue.
	We add a sink t that goes from all the projects with negative revenue, with capacity=revenue.
	All other edges have capacity infinity (thus any cut we do won't include edges of infinity).

	The edges in the minimum cut are the profitable projects we didn't choose, and the costly projects we did choose. We want to minimize this.

COMPLEXITY:
	Apply Ford-Fulkerson to get max flow.
	Once we know the max flow, we can compute the minimum cut in O(m) time, by performing a BFS from s on the residual graph. The points in the BFS tree represent one side of the cut.
