BIPARTITE MATCHING

PROBLEM:
	We have a bipartite graph between partitions X and Y.

GOAL:
	We want to find a matching (each node appears in one edge) such that we have the most edges.

ALGORITHM:
	Make all edges directed from X to Y.
	Make an s go to X.
	Make all Y go to a t.
	Give all edges a capacity of 1.

	Apply Ford-Fulkerson.
