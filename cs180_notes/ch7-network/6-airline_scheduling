AIRLINE SCHEDULING

PROBLEM:
	A flight path consists of an origin and destination, and an arrival and destination time.
	We have m such paths.
	We have k planes.

GOAL:
	Is it possible to fulfill all m paths?

ALGORITHM:
	Flights are directed edges of capacity 1, with beginnings ui and ends vi. These have a lower bound of 1 (they must be filled).
	If a flight i can reach a flight j (the arrival time of i is before the departure time of j), there will be a directed edge from vi to uj.
	A source s goes to a beginning node with capacity k.
	The beginning node goes to each ui with capacity of 1.
	A sink t goes from each vj with capacity of 1.

	Apply Ford-Fulkerson's Algorithm and see if we can satisfy all the lower bounds.
